- **User Feedback**: Community-driven insights from 50+ user ratings
- **Cost Analysis**: Budget compatibility and cost-effectiveness assessment

### 2. Comprehensive Recommendations
- **Overall Score**: Weighted combination of all factors (0-1 scale)
- **Recommendation Level**: proceed, proceed_with_caution, reconsider, not_recommended
- **Confidence Score**: Reliability of the recommendation
- **Detailed Analysis**: Breakdown of each factor's contribution
- **Actionable Suggestions**: Specific recommendations for trip planning

### 3. Real-time Analysis
